<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
    <li>2 ¼ cups bread flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons instant nonfat dry milk</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons instant yeast</li>
    <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 egg yolk</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
    <li>9 ounces semisweet chocolate chunks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 1</h2>
Gather the ingredients.
<h2>Step 2</h2>
Pour water into a bread machine pan; add flour. Sprinkle milk powder over flour. Place sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons of softened butter into the corners of the pan. Make a small indent in the top of the dry ingredients and place yeast in the indent. Run the bread machine on the basic dough setting.
<h2>Step 3</h2>
Meanwhile, lay out a sheet of waxed or parchment paper. Shape the remaining 1/2 cup of butter into a 3x5-inch rectangle on the waxed paper; wrap and chill until ready to use.
<h2>Step 4</h2>
Remove butter from the refrigerator and allow to soften while you roll out dough. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; roll into a 8x12-inch rectangle. Place butter on half of the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border of dough on 3 sides. Fold the other half of dough over butter and press the edges firmly to seal.
<h2>Step 5</h2>
Roll the dough out to a 6x14-inch rectangle. Fold the dough in thirds from the long ends, as you would fold a business letter. Cover dough loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 20 minutes.
<h2>Step 6</h2>
Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Place it onto a lightly floured surface so that the folded edge faces you. Roll the dough out again into a 6x14-inch rectangle, and fold into thirds. Cover with plastic and chill for 20 minutes.
<h2>Step 7</h2>
Repeat step 5, then chill the dough for 30 minutes.
<h2>Step 8</h2>
In a small bowl, beat together the egg yolk and milk; set aside. Grease two baking sheets.
<h2>Step 9</h2>
Roll dough out into a 12x21-inch rectangle. Cut dough into thirds in both directions, to make 9 rectangles. Divide chocolate among the rectangles. Lightly brush egg yolk mixture around the edges of each piece. Starting at a short end, roll each piece of dough around the chocolate; press the edges together to seal.
<h2>Step 10</h2>
Place the croissants onto the prepared baking sheets; cover with greased plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place until they have doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
<h2>Step 11</h2>
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Brush the top of the pastries with the remaining egg yolk mixture.
<h2>Step 12</h2>
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer croissants to wire racks. Serve warm or at room temperature.
